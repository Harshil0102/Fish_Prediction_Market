# Fish Weight Prediction Web Application

## Overview
This project aims to predict the weight of fish species based on various attributes using machine learning. It includes building a Random Forest Regression model trained on the Fish Market dataset and deploying it as a web application with a frontend interface for user interaction.

## Project Structure

### 1. Machine Learning Model
- **Model**: Random Forest Regression
- **Techniques**: Grid Search CV for hyperparameter tuning

### 2. Web Application
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS for user interface
  - Input form for fish attributes
  - Form validation using JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python Flask for server-side logic
  - Integration with the trained model for predictions
- **Deployment**: Render for hosting the application online
